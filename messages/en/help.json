For example: payroll requires attendance data, attendance requires an active contract."

Contract must be active\n3. **Configure salary** — Set salary type (monthly, daily, hourly, shift-based) and base amount\n4. **Add allowances** — Add fixed or conditional allowances\n5. **Add deductions** — Add fixed or percentage-based deductions\n\n**Why is a contract needed?** The system uses contracts to determine if an employee is currently working. No active contract = cannot check in, cannot calculate payroll.\n\n**Why configure salary?** Without salary configuration, the system cannot calculate base pay. Payslip will show 0."
